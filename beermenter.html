                                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                <p> With over 300 thousand different kinds of beers today, beer has created 
                                    a community of zythophiles. Beer culture is rather prevalent in the U.S. 
                                    to where even my campus, UC San Diego, holds an event called Bear [Beer] Garden 
                                    where different beers are offered for those of age to explore. The Beermenter 
                                    project was brought up with the intention to tackle any problems one would encounter 
                                    when consuming beer. In the class COGS 120: Interaction Design, I worked with a team 
                                    of 3 to discover and tackle any possible problems one may come across when 
                                    drinking beer.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="desc">
                                <h3>Scope</h3>
                                <p>The inspiration for this project stems from my team’s confusion entering the beer 
                                    culture. As a team of 3 who have all recently turned 21, we were unfamiliar with 
                                    the terminology, flavors, and how to even order; it was difficult to choose the “right” 
                                    beer based solely off the name. My team wanted to design an app that would tackle this 
                                    issue by “mentoring” newcomers, making their beer-related selections quicker and easier.
                                    </p>

                            </div>

                                <h3>Needfinding</h3>
                                <p>Before going out into the field, my team wanted to know the exact number of 
                                    people we’d be designing for. That is — how many people actually drink beer? 
                                    And how often do they attend breweries?.   </p>

                                    
    
                                <p>It was important for us to perform an ethnographic study (with participants’ permission 
                                    ) before asking for a formal interview. We wanted to observe the entire brewery
                                    experience from purchasing beers to chugging one down. Once we finished the observation 
                                    process, we noticed that three questions extracted the richest data from our 
                                    participants.
                                    </p>

                                    <li>Why do you drink beer?</li>
                                    <li>How do you know what beer to buy?</li>
                                </ol>

                                        <li><strong>People tend to attend breweries for the social experience rather than the beer itself.</strong> There are many 
                                            components that are important to a customer at a restaurant — atmosphere, food, etc. But at a brewery, 
                                            the most important factor was the company. </li>
                                        <li><strong>People drink beer because it has a flavor like no other.</strong> Most beers tend to be bitter, 
                                            but there are so many different flavor profiles that drinking.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Most of the time people don’t know what kind of drinks they want.</strong> They’re confronted 
                                            with the paradox of choice — the idea that the more choices presented to someone, the less 
                                            likely they are to make a decision. When coming to brewery, a menu can have anywhere from 10 
                                            to 50 beers. But those who constantly want to try new flavors are essentially flipping a coin 
                                            when it comes to selecting a good flavor.</li>

                                <p> As the sole designer, I created 
                                        low-fidelity wireframes as a way to easily visualize the necessary changes to 
                                        provide my team a visible direction for the app. 

                                    I designed how a user could pick a beer from start to finish, first beginning 
                                    with the initial question of which brewery they were at, what kind of taste 
                                    profile did they desire, and so forth til they reached their suggested beer. 
                                    Design iteration was faster through sketching, allowing us to change our sketches 
                                    easily after our initial round of feedback.

                                <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
                                <p>Despite the critique of our initial prototypes, we knew that our wireframes 
                                    were far from ready. Therefore, we and others performed a heuristic evaluation on our prototype 
                                    using <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"><u> Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics.</u></a> When you get deeper and deeper into the design process, it’s easy to forget 
                                    who you’re designing for. A heuristic evaluation allowed our team narrow our 
                                    focus even further and refocus on the user.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Familiar metaphors and language.</strong>
                                    Users can filter beers through a variety of traits, such as type and flavor. However, these traits,
                                     especially for people who are new to the beer drinking scene, can be a bit ambiguous. For example, 
                                     what is an IPA? What exactly is the flavor of “golden” beer?</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>User control and freedom.</strong>
                                Although users can be recommended beer, there’s no way for users to keep track of 
                                    what they’ve drank. Users may be recommended the same beer over and over, and there’s 
                                    nothing the user can do about it.</p>

                                <p>Other less notable violations include a violation of error prevention and 
                                    aesthetic/minimalist design.</p>

                                     wireframes, it was finally time to breathe some life into them through visual
                                     design. I created a simple style guide that would be implemented throughout the web

                                <p>For this round of usability testing, we gave users a lot of freedom to explore 
                                    the app. Becaues functionality of the app was minimal, we didn't provide specific tasks for 
                                    the user to follow. However, we did give a general task list for the user as our 
                                    primary focus was pinpointing usability issues. If an issue was encountered, users were further 
                                    questioned to determine how severe the usability issue was.</p>

                                <p>We also created performance metrics to determine if users engaged with
                                    a feature or saw it as useful. Some metrics include: </p>

                                    <ul>
                                            <li>how many times a user mentions a filter</li>

                                <p> Time and time again I learn the sensitive nature of design. It always challenges me by 
                                    asking me what I’m going to do when things don’t go the way I expect. That’s what I love about design 
                                    — it’s the perfect field where you should expect the unexpected. </p>

                                <p>Things I wish I could’ve done:</p>

                                <p><strong>Make complete use of the login.</strong>  I would’ve liked to implement a profile and some sort of share functionality. 
                                    After all, from what we’ve learned from users, visiting breweries is socially driven.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Find <i>better</i> spots to explain the words associated with beer.</strong> There is a lot of beer terminology. And despite the fact that users encountered little to no issues when it came to 
                                    learning what this terminology meant, I can’t help but think that there’s more I could’ve done to immerse themselves in the 
                                    beer culture. Maybe a tutorial… or maybe I’m overthinking everything.</p>

                                <p>I’d like to thank Justin and Etsu for doing an amazing job on this project — 
                                    you guys were both amazing teammates and I’m proud of what were able to do in such a short amount of time.</p>
