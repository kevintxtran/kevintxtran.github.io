                                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                <p> I recently turned 21. With 21 comes a responsibility — drinking alcohol. 
                                    Though, the segway for many people comes is drinking. There’s a huge beer 
                                    drinking culture around the US and even an event on the UC San Diego campus 
                                    called Bear [Beer] Garden. With such a culture surrounding the alcoholic 
                                    beverage, I wanted to solve any problems people might have while drinking beer. </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="desc">
                                <h3>Scope</h3>
                                <p>As a team of 3 who have all recently turned 21, the world of beer is intimidating. There are so many different types and flavor profiles that 
                                        it’s intimidating to even order at a brewery. There’s an entire culture surrounding the world of beer, which is why we wanted to create an 
                                        app that would be beginner friendly. When trying something new, people shouldn’t be intimidated by the number of choices or by words they don’t 
                                        understand. Our inspiration came from our own confusion as young adults entering a completely new field.
                                        </p>

                            </div>

                            <div class="desc">
                                <h3>Needfinding</h3>
                                <p>Before going out into the field, my team wanted to know the exact number of 
                                    people we’d be designing for. That is — how many people actually drink beer? 
                                    And how often do they attend breweries?.   </p>
    
                                <p>It was important for us to perform an ethnographic study (with participants’ permission 
                                    of course) before asking for a formal interview. We wanted to observe the entire brewery
                                    experience from purchasing beers to chugging one down. Once we finished the observation 
                                    process, we noticed that three questions extracted the richest data from our 
                                    participants.
                                    </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Why do you come to breweries?</li>
                                    <li>Why do you drink beer?</li>
                                    <li>How do you know what beer to buy?</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>These were the three most crucial questions when it came our interviews because it 
                                    revealed their biggest needs.
                                    </p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>People tend to attend breweries for the social experience rather than the beer itself.</strong> There are many 
                                            components that are important to a customer at a restaurant — atmosphere, food, etc. But at a brewery, 
                                            the most important factor was the company. </li>
                                        <li><strong>People drink beer because it has a flavor like no other.</strong> Most beers tend to be bitter, 
                                            but there are so many different flavor profiles that drinking.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Most of the time people don’t know what kind of drinks they want.</strong> They’re confronted 
                                            with the paradox of choice — the idea that the more choices presented to someone, the less 
                                            likely they are to make a decision. When coming to brewery, a menu can have anywhere from 10 
                                            to 50 beers. But those who constantly want to try new flavors are essentially flipping a coin 
                                            when it comes to selecting a good flavor.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    to three 21 year olds in a group.</p>

                                <p>We sketched out wireframes of what we thought would  fulfill our user needs — an app that would 
                                    simplify the beer selection process? But how exactly would we do that? We first sketched paper 
                                    prototypes to perform rapid user testing. And although our paper prototypes did look a higher 
                                    fidelity than your typical paper prototype, there were still many, many issues with the iteration. 
                                    Sketching allowed us to quickly and easily draw up another UI during our initial round of 
                                    feedback.</p>

                                        changes. The goal of the wireframes was to map out a loose user journey and in the
                                         process, give our team some direction.</p></p>

                                <p>Despite the initial critique of our paper prototypes, we knew that our wireframes 
                                    were far from ready. Therefore, we and others performed a heuristic evaluation on our prototype 
                                    using <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"><u> Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics.</u></a> When you get deeper and deeper into the design process, it’s easy to forget 
                                    who you’re designing for. A heuristic evaluation allowed our team narrow our 
                                    focus even further and refocus on the user.

                                    Users can filter beers through a variety of traits, such as type and flavor. However, these traits,
                                     especially for people who are new to the beer drinking scene, can be a bit ambiguous. For example, 
                                     what is an IPA? What exactly is the flavor of “golden” beer?</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>User control and freedom</strong>
                                Although users can be recommended beer, there’s no way for users to keep track of 
                                    what they’ve drank. Users may be recommended the same beer over and over, and there’s 
                                    nothing the user can do about it.</p>

                                <p>Other less notable violations include a violation of error prevention and 
                                    aesthetic/minimalist design.</p>

                                reminded people of beer, but also remind people that beer connects. It is a social catalyst and despite being 
                                chilled, evokes a warm feeling when surrounded by company. </p>

                                <p>Even with a solid deliverable, our team always kept in mind that there is always room for 
                                    improvement. For this round of usability testing, we gave users a lot of freedom when exploring 
                                    the app. We did not provide specific tasks because the functionality of the app minimal 
                                    (compared to a social media app). However,  we did give a general task list for the user as our 
                                    primary focus was pinpointing usability issues. If an issue was encountered, users were further 
                                    questioned to determine how severe the usability issue was.</p>

                                <p>Once we outlined the issues of our app, we sought out to fix those issues. 
                                    These included but are not limited to poor menu navigation and unnecessary features. 
                                    Another second round of usability testing was conducted, but with more directed tasks. 
                                    Our team created performance metrics to determine the superior redesign. Some metrics included </p>

                                <p> Time and time again I learn the sensitive nature of design. It always challenges me by 
                                    asking me what I’m going to do when things don’t go the way I expect. That’s what I love about design 
                                    — it’s the perfect field where you should expect the unexpected. </p>

                                <p>Things I wish I could’ve done:</p>

                                <p><strong>Make complete use of the login.</strong>  I would’ve liked to implement a profile and some sort of share functionality. 
                                    After all, from what we’ve learned from users, visiting breweries is socially driven.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Find <i>better</i> spots to explain the words associated with beer.</strong>There is a lot of beer terminology. And despite the fact that users encountered little to no issues when it came to 
                                    learning what this terminology meant, I can’t help but think that there’s more I could’ve done to immerse themselves in the 
                                    beer culture. Maybe a tutorial… or maybe I’m overthinking everything.</p>

                                <p>I’d like to thank Justin and Etsu for doing an amazing job on this project — 
                                    you guys were both amazing teammates and I’m proud of what were able to do in such a short amount of time.</p>
