                                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                <p> This past summer, I’ve had the pleasure of being a UX Intern at ResMed. ResMed is a medical equipment based 
                                    company whose speciality lies in developing technology to treat sleep apnea. This includes but is not limited 
                                    to portable oxygen concentrators (POCs), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines, and masks. I was
                                    brought on to work on the various software that would allow patients to visualize their sleep data as well as other 
                                    internal software.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="desc">
                                <h3>Goals</h3>
                                <p>I wanted real experience working with people. Being a student, 
                                    it’s easy to forget that you spend most of your time in a bubble, 
                                    among like-minded and like-aged people. This internship gave me the 
                                    opportunity to work with people of varying ages and backgrounds from 
                                    around the world. I wanted to understand people through a much larger scope.   </p>
                                <p>My primary goal was to learn the ins and outs of the user research process 
                                    and how to optimally extract information through user testing. </p>
                                <p>My secondary goal was to improve my technical design skills, more 
                                    specifically, creating wireframes and user flows.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="desc">
                                <h3>What I worked on</h3>

                                <p>I was tasked with working on a variety of projects, allowing me to hone many different areas of UX research and design. These tasks included 
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Moderated user testing</li>
                                        <li>Unmoderated user testing</li>
                                        <li>Creating testing protocol
                                        <li>Creating wireframes and lo-fi prototypes</li>
                                        <li> and more. </li> 
                                    </ul>
                                <p>My first week, I was greeted with a lot of confusing ResMed software that all sounded alike to me.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>myAir</li>
                                    <li>myMobi</li>
                                    <li>AirMini</li>
                                    <li>AirView</li>
                                    <li>AirSense</li>
                                    <li>Airbnb</li>
								</ul>
                             
                                <p>Just kidding about the last one.</p>

                                <p> But there was one project that allowed me to really test my design skills: the revamp of an internal app, ResAssist. ResAssist is an app
                                    that would only be used by ResMed employees. There was already an 
                                    iteration of the ResAssist app, but it needed a huge redesign. The app was created 
                                    with WordPress. </p>
                                    
                                <p> I didn’t even know you could create apps with WordPress.</p>

                                <p>There was no clear direction as to what a ResMedian would do with ResAssist. 
                                    Therefore my team, the Global Health Informatics UX Team, reached out to 
                                    the IT department for additional debriefing.</p>

                                <p>To try to understand what was wrong with the app, I performed guerrilla testing on 10 employees. 
                                Every app begins with a purpose, or else it becomes irrelevant. Therefore, given that the purpose of ResAssist is to
                                "facilitate the life of a daily ResMed employee," how well did employees think it fulfilled its purpose?    
                                </p> 

                                
                                
                                <!-- <p>Primary findings include:</p>
                                <p><b>Users felt like the Wi-Fi password was difficult to access.</b> 
                                    Users found it annoying to have to click a button to access the Wi-Fi password. 
                                    There is also no copy/paste function in the app, therefore users must memorize the 
                                    password and input it themselves.</p>
                                <p><b>Users didn’t know what the “Upcoming” page was for.</b> 
                                    Once users tapped on the “Upcoming” button, there was no information 
                                    as to what the contents of the page were supposed to be.</p>
                                <p><b>The user can’t tap buttons.</b> 
                                    Buttons that look tappable should be tappable.</p> -->
                                
                                <h3>The Problem</h3>    
                                <p> Users see no value in ResAssist. 
                                    They have no reason to open the app for whatever reason.
                                    If users saw no value in ResAssist, how could we hope to create value? </p>

                                            <h3>Wireframing and More Testing</h3>
                                            
                                            <p>Users had no interest in the old ResAssist because it was poorly designed. 
                                                The new ResAssist aims to fix the usability problems and provide a fresh look
                                                to ResMed employees.
                                                After the first round of usability testing, I created 
                                                wireframes for the first iteration of a redesigned ResAssist.</p>

                                    <li>A support page to allow easy access to technical support</li>
                                    <li>AJAIJ An integrated ticket system, allowing employees to forego an unpleasant web experience</li>

                                the same users would be, thus I looked to test on 5 new users. 
                                
                                
                                <!-- Biggest findings included: 
                            
                            <p><b>Signing in has no real purpose.</b> 
                                There is a point to signing into the ticketing system. 
                                However, does signing in to the ResAssist mean that the pages are customizable? 
                                Could the ResAssist UI be unique to each person? Is there enough content to implement 
                                customization? </p>
                            
                            <p><b>The homepage doesn’t look like a homepage. </b>
                                Upon logging into ResAssist, the user is taken to the “Support” page that consists 
                                of the Wi-Fi password and contact numbers. This is an odd way to welcome employees 
                                to an app. Despite having the least amount of content, users spent a great deal of 
                                time looking at the “Support” page.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>ServiceNow integration: yes! </b>
                                Live chat was praised. A live chat humanizes the ticketing experience. 
                                Assigning faces to names makes the user feel like their ticket wasn’t just thrown 
                                in with all other tickets. Including more details about the ticket itself (open, closed, etc.) 
                                prevents users from feeling like information is being hidden from them.</p>
                            <p>After a couple more meetings, it was determined that a ticketing system could not be implemented within 
                                the deadlines. Nevertheless, I continued with more user testing.</p> -->

                                <p>Our ticketing idea... did not come to fruition. Unfortunately, it was at this point
                                    of the project where deadlines and feasibility issues came to fruition instead. 
                                </p>
                                <p> Therefore, our primary focus was visually updating ResAssist as well as continuing to conduct more user testing. The infeasibility of ServiceNow integration resulted in the 
                                    creation of a dashboard – a homepage that contains information relevant to the ResMed employee. 
                                    This dashboard consisted of a lunch menu, a list of recommended/saved events, and floor plans (people are moving <i>all the time</i>.
                                    This dashboard update was paired with updates to color and iconography.</p>

                                        When they sit in meetings and at their desks all day, it’s unfulfilling and frustrating 
                                        to not make any progress. With the variety of software available to employees, a bad user 
                                        experience paired with unproductive meetings can easily snowball into a poor day. </p>

                                    <p> With this finding, the possibilities seemed endless. How could we help ResMed employees feel accomplished? This question intrigued me to no end.</p>

                                <p><b>Working with Axure.</b>
                                    I’m very adamant about wireframing with Sketch because it looked the best out of other 
                                    software I’ve used (wireframes need to look somewhat pretty too!) But I’ve never had 
                                    more fun creating wireframes. Axure was easy and intuitive, yet powerful when it came
                                     to creating wireframes and user flows. 
                                </p>

                                <p><b>Really evaluating user flows and information architecture. </b>
                                    I was able to articulate my evaluations much clearer. I improved my ability 
                                    to critique rather than criticize.
                                </p>

                                <p><b>Working with a variety of people.</b> 
                                    As I’ve mentioned before, all of my previous projects have involved college 
                                    students between the ages of 18-21. I like to think I can guess what their 
                                    responses will be. In this environment, I had absolutely no clue what anyone was thinking, 
                                    which is the beauty of user testing. 
                                    <b>I loved not knowing.</b>
