                                <p> TrueNutrition is a company that prides itself on the most optimal supplements 
                                    for all kinds of athletes. In fact, it’s where I get my supplements from. But 
                                    what makes TrueNutrition special is the ability to customize the flavor and 
                                    boosts of your supplement. I personally love ordering from TrueNutrition, but 
                                    find the overall process to navigate to the desired product can be confusing.
                                </p>
                                <p>As a personal project, I set out to discover if others found any issues with the 
                                    process and how I could improve it.</p> 
                            </div>

                                <h3>Interviews</h3>
                                <p>I visited my local gym to interview 6 users about their experience using 
                                    supplements as well as conduct guerrilla testing on TrueNutrition’s website. 
                                    These users were both male and female ages 17-35, with experience ranging 
                                    from beginner (6mo-1yr) to seasoned (5+ years).  </p>
                                <p>I specifically wanted insight 
                                    on TrueNutrition’s entire purchasing process to understand what problems users 
                                    would encounter (if any problems at all). To do so, I created an interview guide 
                                    to inquire about their general knowledge of fitness supplements and their 
                                    thoughts/feelings on certain functions during the purchasing process. 
                                    For the test, users customized the most common fitness supplement: protein powder.

                            <p>Users didn’t have any issues finding the product, but problems arose once they clicked 
                                on a product of interest. Users felt that there was “too much going on” when it came to 
                                color and overall layout. Once they began to customize their product, users were frustrated 
                                by the lack of clarity and transparency of the process.

                                <p>I initially believed that the entire purchasing process, beginning with the landing page, 
                                    suffered from usability issues. However, none of the 6 users had issues locating the 
                                    product. It was clear that users struggled to complete actions while customizing their 
                                    protein. As a result of this finding, I mapped out the interactions of focus.

                                    citing it as an unique experience. One quote that stuck with me was “it’s my protein now!” 
                                    It helped me understand that customization wasn’t just a process, it was an experience,

                                <p>I synthesized my findings, identified my target user, and narrowed my focus to a 
                                    single problem statement: how might we improve the customization experience of 
                                    TrueNutrition supplements for a gym-goer?</p>

                                <p>TrueNutrition allows you to customize a pre-made blend with flavors and boosts for an 
                                    additional cost. Upon scouring the internet, I only found one other company that 
                                    provided the same service. Another site tailors the protein powder by asking for 
                                    the user’s proportions, fitness goals, etc. 
                                   </p>
                                <p>Something they both had in common? Their customization process was streamlined 
                                    step-by-step rather than overloading the user with information on a single page. 
                                    A step-by-step process makes it feel as if you were building your own personal 
                                    product, rather than throwing a bunch of random ingredients together.

                                <p>I explored how the product details would look and how it would transition
                                     into a customization state. Based on my research, I found that the importance 
                                     of product customization is making the experience more personal. Therefore, I needed to explore
                                       how to visualize that experience in a coherent manner.

                                <p>An experience is more than the sum of its parts. Sitting down and pinpointing each 
                                    interaction and improving those interactions, well… I feel like that couldn’t have 
                                    been done without thorough understanding of my user.  I came into the project believing
                                    that the problem was bigger than it actually was, but time and time again I find myself
                                    humbled from talking to other users. Tackling this problem was a blast because I see
                                    these users fairly often, but never made conversation with them. To be able to walk
                                    through their thoughts on a product important to both of us makes me realize that
                                    there’s always more to learn. </p>
