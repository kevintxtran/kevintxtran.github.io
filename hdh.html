                                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                <p>College students suck at eating healthy. Research shows that most don’t even get their recommended one of five servings of vegetables a day. But maybe they’re not entirely to blame -- there aren’t many options for healthy, quick meals on campus. To combat this college epidemic, we designed app rewards system called Healthy Dining Habits. </p>
                                <p>We hoped to collaborate with UCSD Housing Dining & Hospitality (HDH) so that, based on the number of points they earn from healthy purchases, they’ll be entered in a lottery for prizes such as Amazon gift cards. </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="desc">
                                <h3>User Research</h3>
                                <p>First and foremost, we wanted to interview students who lived on campus and learn why they opt for unhealthy foods. As students ourselves, we could hypothesize what our interviewees would answer, but wanted to empathize with other students throughout the interview process. </p>                                
                                <p>UC San Diego’s dining system revolves around “dining dollars,” money that can only be spent at campus markets and dining halls. From our interviews, we learned that students do not view dining dollars as real money because it is included in their tuition. This system enables students to sporadically spend their food on what tastes good, rather than what is good for their body. It’s easier to open a bag of chips than to purchase fresh ingredients and cook at home.
                                <p>We had also put out a survey and received 21 responses. Students who lived on campus reported that they valued nutrition over all else. However, our field observations revealed the exact opposite: <b>students actually prioritize convenience over nutrition.</b> They would stand in front of the frozen food aisles and chips section, contemplating between various unhealthy foods. </p>
                                <p>Our findings led us to the following question: <b>how might we encourage students to purchase groceries and make their own meals?</b></p>

                                <p>In order to further understand our stakeholders, we created three different personas.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>An unhealthy student who doesn’t know how to cook but also wants to eat healthier.</li>
                                    <li>A health-conscious student who has no time to learn new recipes.</li>
                                    <li>An HDH manager who understands that students lack the necessary nutrients.</li>

                                <p>We as a team created multiple storyboards in order to view our problems within the context of the problem space. During this stage of our ideation, the sky was the limit.</p>

                                <p>At this point of the ideation process, we needed to turn wild ideas into feasible ones. Because our initial personas had revolved the idea that healthy eating should be done through cooking, we thought that pre-prepared meal boxes were a possible solution -- human centered design. </p>                            
                                <p>However, this “solution” would be nothing new -- many grocery stores already sell these boxes. We wanted to design something that unique to UC San Diego students.</p>

								<p>We came to the conclusion that we didn't <b>fully understand who our users were.</b></p>
                                <p>College students have busy lives. 24 hours just isn't enough time for them to do everything they want too -- it becomes so easy to resort to comfort foods. <b>We knew we couldn’t force students to eat healthy.</b> Thus, we sought to incentivize healthy eating through a mobile app instead.</p>

                                <p>After another round of user testing, we discovered some issues with the prototype such as:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>An unclear path to weekly prizes</li>
                                    <li>A misunderstanding of what the lottery system was</li>

                                <h3>Final Reflection</h3>
                                <p>A major takeaway from this entire design process was learning what it means to take part in a <b>user-centered design</b>. My team’s initial approach to this problem space was to encourage healthy eating by placing boxes in an aisle that students never visited in the first place. What we thought was a good solution might have worked out, <b>but it was not the correct solution</b>. We as a team needed to analyze our findings even further and truly understand what the user needs.</p>
                                <p>Empathy is a compelling emotion. As a student researching students and designing for them, it puts into perspective how similar some of our problems really are. We all have exams and projects to worry about, so sometimes we place our health to the bottom of the priority list. Being able to to empathize with these students through storyboarding and interviewing contributed to this gratifying design process.</p>
