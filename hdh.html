                                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                <p>College students <strong>suck</strong> at eating healthy. Research shows that most don’t even get their recommended one of five servings of vegetables a day. But maybe they’re not entirely to blame -- there aren’t many options for healthy, quick meals on campus. To combat this college epidemic, we designed app rewards system called Healthy Dining Habits. </p>
                                <p>We hoped to collaborate with UCSD Housing Dining & Hospitality (HDH) so that, based on the number of points they earn from healthy purchases, they’ll be entered in a lottery for prizes such as Amazon gift cards. </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="desc">
                                <h3>Needfinding</h3>
                                <p>First and foremost, we wanted to interview students who lived on campus and learn why they opt for unhealthy foods. As students ourselves, we could hypothesize what our interviewees would answer, but wanted to empathize with other students throughout the interview process. </p>                                
								<p>UC San Diego’s dining system revolves around “dining dollars,” money that can only be spent at campus markets and dining halls. From our interviews, we learned that students do not view dining dollars as real money because it is included in their tuition. This system enables students to sporadically spend their food on what tastes good, rather than what is good for their body. It’s easier to open a bag of chips than to purchase fresh ingredients and cook at home.</p>

                                <p>We had also put out a survey and received 21 responses. Students who lived on campus reported that they valued nutrition over all else. However, <b>our field observations revealed the exact opposite</b>: students prioritize convenience over nutrition. They would stand in front of the frozen food aisles and chips section, contemplating between various unhealthy foods. </p>
                                <p>Our findings led us to the following question: <b>how might we encourage UCSD students to eat healthier?</b></p>

                                <p>At this point of the ideation process, we needed to turn wild ideas into feasible ones. Because our initial personas had revolved the idea that healthy eating should be done through cooking, we thought that pre-prepared meal boxes were a possible solution -- human centered design. </p>                            
                                <p>However, this “solution” would be nothing new. Meal prep boxes already exist and students, no matter how easy it may be, do not want to cook on a busy schedule.
									Therefore, we wanted to design something that would be unique to UC San Diego students. </p>
																
									<p>We came to the conclusion that <b>we didn't fully understand who our users were.</b></p>

                                <p>College students have busy lives. 24 hours just isn't enough time for them to do everything they want to do -- it becomes so easy to resort to comfort foods. <b>We knew we couldn’t force students to eat healthy.</b> Thus, we sought to incentivize healthy eating through a mobile app instead.</p>

                                <p>It hit us. A rewards system! You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.

								<p>Okay, maybe that analogy doesn't perfectly fit. What I meant to say is: we can't make 
									students eat healthy, but we can incentivize it through gamification. After all, 
									who doesn't love to compete?
								</p>
									I sketched up some possible mockups of the app on paper. 
									Paper prototyping allowed our team to really take advantage of our design pivot. We went through many iterations, allowing us 
									to pinpoint inconsistencies and fix them in minutes. </p>

								<p>It was at this point where I realized: I've never been so excited to create.</p>

						<br><strong>Why:</strong> Users noted that entering the raffle felt "off" and felt as if it needed more pizazz. 
							The screen also is filled to the brim with information and needed a touching up.
						A larger progress bar would help the user own their progress and be proud of their accomplishment.
					Entering a raffle needed more significance because it was the culmination of obtaining enough points.</p>

						<p><strong>Changes:</strong> We decreased the visibility of the date/time and 
								placed more of an emphasis on points. We added points earned from each item (with color coding) along with a point total from
								each purchase. <br>
							
						<strong>Why:</strong> Users felt like the prioritization of information was incorrect; they wanted
							information concerning their points and how many points an item was worth.

					<strong>Why:</strong> Users didn't want to dive into the Rewards tab just to check 
						if they had entered the raffle. A greeting message, although encouraging, 
						becomes redundant after a set number of logins.

								<h3>Reflection</h3>
								<p>I couldn't be more proud of our team, to realize
									our errors and refocus with such short deadlines. One of my issues as a designer is fixating on a solution -- but we successfully pivoted from our narrowminded thinking and delivered a solution we believed to be useful to the students of UCSD.
								</p>
                                <p>A major takeaway from this entire design process was learning what it means to take part in a <b>user-centered design</b>. My team’s initial approach to this problem space was to encourage healthy eating by placing boxes in an aisle that students never visited in the first place. What we thought was a good solution might have worked out, <b>but it was not the correct solution</b>. We as a team needed to analyze our findings even further and truly understand what the user needs.</p>
                                <p>Empathy is a compelling emotion. As a student researching students and designing for them, it puts into perspective how similar some of our problems really are. We all have exams and projects to worry about, so sometimes we place our health to the bottom of the priority list. Being able to to empathize with these students through storyboarding and interviewing contributed to this gratifying design process.</p>
