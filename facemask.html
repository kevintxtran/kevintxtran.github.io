                                <p> Design touches every aspect 
                                    of the fan’s experience. At the NFL, the goal was to establish the 
                                    products as the trusted source and authority of all things football.</p>

                                <p>Building credibility begins with consistency. 
                                    A cohesive experience needed to be delivered across all devices, 
                                    no matter their level of football knowledge. However, with 32 NFL 
                                    Football teams, each with distinct identities/brands, delivering consistent 
                                    experiences across 3 different platforms (mobile, web, connected TV) presented 
                                    an enormous resource challenge. </p>

                                <br>
                                <p>To deliver consistent fan experiences without exponentially 
                                    increasing support costs, the NFL needed design to scale</p>
									
                                    <h3>Problems</h3>
                                    <p>The NFL is a fast paced environment that is subject to many 
                                        priority shifts throughout the year. Therefore, product teams were 
                                        typically left with options that didn’t scale well, were expensive, 
                                        or both.
                                        </p>

                                        <img class="fill-container" src="images/nfl/nfl-problems.png">
                                        <p class="caption">With many deadlines, the NFL typically needed to quickly and inefficiently spend money.</p>
                                        <br>
                                <p>As a solution, the NFL shifted towards a component based design system. However, 
                                    the adoption of a new methodology came a new issue. Using a component 
                                    based design system required a long term effort/investment by the product team, 
                                    an idea that seemed infeasible for an organization that has many of its deadlines 
                                    predetermined by seasonal events.</p>
                                <p>The design system, named Facemask, needed to be added slowly on a project-by-project basis. </p>

                                <h3>Impacts</h3>
                                <p>With the adoption of Facemask, the system gradually became more 
                                    comprehensive and ameliorated other issues within the organization.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Communication between product teams improved</li>
                                        <li>Product strategy became transparent/visible to all employees</li>
                                        <li>No more ambiguity communicating the design process</li>
                                        <li>Design feedback became more focused and actionable</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <br>

                                <h4>Better Communication</h4>
                                <p>Before Facemask, communication between designers typically broke down 
                                    as a result of the NFL’s pressing deadlines. It wasn’t uncommon for 
                                    designers to create different solutions to the same problem. 
                                    As a result, design debt accumulated and continuity seemed 
                                    impossible to manage.</p>
                                
                                    <img class="fill-container" src="images/nfl/nfl-signup.png">
                                    <p class="caption">Two designers created the same signup page but with different components, demonstrating the need for version control.</p>
                                    <br>

                                <p>As Facemask evolved, knowledge shared by the product team became more 
                                    uniform. Digital products began to share functional and visual qualities, 
                                    eliminating the need for custom solutions.</p>
                                    <br>

                                <h3>Minimizing Resources Spent</h3>
                                <p>Each NFL team was responsible for the design of their own website. 
                                    Some teams had their own design teams, while others hired external agencies. 
                                    As a result, each team’s website had drastically different levels of quality 
                                    and usability. </p>
                                    <img class="fill-container" src="images/nfl/nfl-teams.png">
                                    <br>
                                <p>Facemask allowed the NFL to absorb all 32 teams into the redesign of 
                                    NFL.com and eliminate the need of external vendors. The design 
                                    system evenly distributed each team’s online representation with less 
                                    invested resources.</p>

                                <h4>Fostering Innovation</h4>
                                <p>With an entire system of standards and reusable component libraries in place, 
                                    the NFL avoided redundant solutions. Each designer could work under a 
                                    unified set of guidelines that allowed them to focus less on clarifying 
                                    their solution and more on iterating existing experiences. Facemask 
                                    allowed designers to explore different interactions based on reusable 
                                    components. It gave the NFL the opportunity to truly understand the needs 
                                    of football fans and create the ultimate football experience.</p>
                                    <br>
                                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                                <h4>Rate of Adoption</h4>
                                <p>Getting teams to adopt new processes is always an obstacle; 
                                    it’s important to remember that teams have other glaring deadlines 
                                    they need to. Facemask was something that needed to be developed over 
                                    time as a means to avoid conflict with existing processes. Facemask was 
                                    described to me as this living, breathing system that is always changing. 
                                    It wasn’t something meant to be shoehorned, but moreso something that 
                                    needed to grow alongside designers.
                                    </p>
                                
                                <h4>Relying on External Work</h4>
                                <p>The NFL is in close touch with select external agencies when 
                                    internal resources become scarce. In a fast paced environment, 
                                    it was inevitable and something out of the designers’ control. However, 
                                    the implementation of Facemask slowly reduced dependency on those external 
                                    agencies.</p>
                                <p>Some agencies realized that adopting Facemask could help them 
                                    secure future opportunities with the NFL, validating the utility of 
                                    Facemask and demanding the need of a way to onboard those agencies quickly. 
                                    (See my with the quickstart guide).
                                    </p>
                                
                                <h4>Shifts in Demand</h4>
                                <p>The NFL is a media company subject to the same challenges as other media companies. 
                                    Declining engagement, plummeting subscriptions, and pressure to 
                                    innovate fostered an ever-changing environment. Facemask allowed the 
                                    product teams to align under set of standards/principles and remain 
                                    focused on business objectives.</p>
