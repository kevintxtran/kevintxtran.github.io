                                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                <p>The harsh reality for young adults (college students especially) is that at one point in time, we have taken our eyes off the road in order to browse through our playlists on a cell phone screen. This inevitable scenario inspired us to reevaluate the playlist usability of Spotify. This reevaluation would gear towards improving driver usability/visibility, but not at the cost of regular usability. In other words, we wanted to redesign Spotify so that it would maintain its usability for non-drivers while improving usability for those behind the wheel.</p>
                                <p>To do so, we as a team conducted user research, compared user flow between apps, analyzed information architecture, and prototyped.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="desc">
                                <h3>Interview Guide</h3>                        
                                <p>We first needed to broaden our scope of questions in order to determine what makes a specific app pleasant to use. As a generation that listens to music every day of our lives, we directed our questions to nine college students of ages 18-21.</p>    
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Where do you listen to music? What do you use to listen to music?</li>
                                    <li>What is your primary music app?</li>
                                    <li>How often do you use the music app?</li>
                                    <li>Do you switch off between music apps? Why?</li>
                                    <li>Think about the last few times you created a playlist. What did you like about the process of creating a playlist?</li>
                                    <li>Did you dislike anything about it? What was it?</li>
                                    <li>Did you run into any complications?</li>
                                    <li>How often do you make playlists? What prompts the decision to do it?</li>
                                    <li>Could you make a playlist for me? Where did you learn to do it like that? How did you do it before? Why did you change?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Seven out of nine of our interviewees noted that they used Spotify as their primary music app. Thus, we looked to reevaluate the app by taking into account the responses of our interviewees and directing that towards our target audience.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="desc">
                                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                                <p>After conducting our interviews, our team traversed popular music apps looking for examples of good/bad user experience flow. Our goal for this was to understand what functions make a music app usable in the first place. By comparing user flow between apps, we aimed to improve our usability evaluation skills, as well as base our design decisions off apps with good flow. Seeing how most of our interviewees used Spotify, we expected most comparisons to result with Spotify coming out on top. But this wasn’t the case.</p>
                                <p>After our user comparisons, we looked to improve upon the flaws of each app as we began to sketch ideas of an app that would first and foremost: <b>be usable.</b></p>

                                <p>We initially came up with three different possibilities that would help cater the app towards drivers:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Increase the size of the buttons to afford easier pressing</li>
                                    <li>Prioritize the back, pause/play, next buttons</li>
                                    <li>Place the ‘+’ button (add to playlist) in spot that would discourage pressing unless safe (Spotify’s ‘+’ button opens a separate screen to add to playlist)</li>
                                </ol>
								<p>We skipped straight to the high fidelity prototypes using InVision.</p>

                                <h3>Design Decision: Information Architecture</h3>
                                <p>What looked to be a trivial issue ended up being one of the topics that sparked the most discussion.</p>
                                <p>On Spotify’s homepage, the headings for playlists are organized as followed:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Made for You</li>
                                    <li>Jump Back In</li>
                                    <li>More Like [playlist name]</li>
                                    <li>Recently Played</li>
								</ul>

									<div class="col-md-12">		
										<img class="centerimg" id="spotia" src="images/spotify/ia.png">

									</div>
								</div>
								
                                <p>In terms of usability and aesthetics, we believed that Spotify implemented the best possible interface. Swiping left/right allows a user to further dive into a heading without endlessly scrolling down. There is a two column layout, as well as a visual signifier to swipe left. We mimicked this layout in our final prototype. What we didn’t mimic is the order in which Spotify organized the headings.</p>
                                <p>Spotify’s home page begins with the heading “Made For You,” a collection of playlists that Spotify creates for the user based on the kind of music they listen to. Our initial disagreement towards this heading was its actual usefulness:</p>
                                <p><b>Argument A</b>: Spotify implementing this is helpful because it allows the user discover new music that they never knew existed. It’s a shortcut to browse music that may not be popular.</p>
                                <p><b>Argument B</b>: Based on the users who preferred Spotify as their main app, none reported that they used “Made For You” to discover new music. Most recall songs that they like or ask for recommendations from friends.</p>

									<div class="col-md-12">		
										<img class="centerimg" id="spotanalyze" src="images/spotify/analyze.png">
										<p class="caption">Analyzing the information architecture of Spotify's homepage</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>There are two reasons as to why Argument B emerged as the superior argument.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><b>It’s all about the user</b>. We initially lost sight of who we were redesigning for. We were so caught up in our personal sentiments towards the heading that we forgot to base our decisions off of user interviews.</li>
                                    <li><b>The target audience is college students.</b> We wanted to cater our app towards college students. All nine of our interviewees were college students, with eight out of nine interviewees reporting that they made their own playlists. Leading us to the inference that we make our own playlists because we want to listen to our own playlists. In turn, we would want to resume listening to a playlist if it were to be interrupted.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>One of our interviewees stated that she would like more options to add songs for a long drive. Once she goes on a road trip with her friends. The car would likely make a pit stop. When the road trip starts up once again, it’d make sense for the playlist (that Kellie took so long to create) would resume playing.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, instead of prioritizing pre-made playlists, we prioritized the “Jump Back In” heading. From there, we decided to remove all headings that tailored the playlist to the specific user (based off our interviews); young adults tend to be more excited about a new album coming out than undiscovered music. When the user opened the app, they would see the following headings without scrolling down:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Jump Back In</li>
                                    <li>New Releases</li>
                                    <li>Genre/Mood</li>
                                    <li>...</li>
                                    <li>...</li> 
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <p>For a more detailed report of our decisions, check out the full case study <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FUiI93oK2U4nkJpRvFYoK1DtV4-KTZ60buye1J_xP18/edit?usp=sharing">here!</a></p>

                                <p>More than anything, this project taught me how crucial user flow is to an app. Although user experience and user interface go hand in hand, it doesn’t matter how good the app looks if it isn’t usable. This project pushed me to explore sections of Spotify/Soundcloud that I never even knew existed, allowing me to see flaws that I otherwise wouldn’t have ever discovered. The design process as a whole was eye opening; although we did not create any low-fidelity prototypes, our team obtained valuable experience by working with InVision and continue to use it to further our careers in design.</p>
